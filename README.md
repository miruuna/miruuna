I am a biochemist turned bioinformatician turned data engineer turned ... mmm ... techientist ... scientechist? Even though I've always been drawn to science, programming and tech has rapidly gained a huge part of my heart. And because I don't want to give up any of them, here I am, trying to understand science one line of code at a time.
